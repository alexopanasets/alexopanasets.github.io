### Worth the Effort: Measuring and Predicting Investment in a Costly Application Process

I run an online hiring experiment wherein I randomly vary the cost of applying for a job, and study whether and how this variation affects the distribution of applicants. The experiment is currently in progress and results are coming soon!

### What Are My Chances? Measuring Job Market Beliefs using Incentives

I gather a novel data set of resumes, search activities, and search outcomes of business school undergraduates looking for summer internships. In an online experiment, I use this data to elicit students’ beliefs regarding the correlation between resume qualifications and likelihood of success on the job market. I incentivize true reporting of these beliefs using a "crossover mechanism" (see, e.g., Mobius et al. (2014)) that has respondents "bet" on the outcomes of other students' job searches. I find that women perceive a stronger correlation between resume qualifications and success than do men (I do not observe any gender-minority respondents in my sample), and that this result cannot be explained by gender differences in willingness to rate a resume as "qualified".

Both men and women believe that resumes rated "not at all qualified" have a low chance of receiving a job offer. Women, however, perceive greater returns to going from not qualified to qualified, as shown by their significantly steeper trend line.](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x2pWzYjrfkXNRrlmHoHd_kJZ6iQhjwXA)

This result may help to explain why women apply to fewer jobs than men (Cortés, et al. (2023), Miano (2023), Tockey & Ignatova (2019)) and become more likely to apply for a job when qualifications become less ambiguous (Coffman, et al. (2023)).

### Maternal Outcomes and Hospital Selection: Evidence from “Baby-Friendly” Hospitals

I study the allocation of “Baby-Friendly” hospital practices developed by the World Health Organization to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Using data from the CDC Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey for years 2007-2018, I find mothers who were ex-ante more likely to breastfeed (educated and white) were also more likely to experience a “Baby-Friendly” birth, even though they are least likely to change their behavior in response to such practices (Hawkins, et al. (2015)). This gap appears to stem from both more-educated patients choosing birthing centers that promote Baby-Friendly practices *and* from birthing centers choosing to offer Baby-Friendly care more often to white and Hispanic mothers than to Black mothers (Sipsma, et al. (2019)). A special "Baby-Friendly" certification, which requires hospitals to implement all recommended practices for the vast majority of births, may help to close the racial gap in exposure to practices by reducing hospitals' incentive to deny Baby-Friendly care to Black mothers, but the education gap in both breastfeeding and access to Baby-Friendly practices would persist.

### Whence the Beef: The Effect of Repealing Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) Using a Vertically Integrated Armington Model with Monte Carlo Simulation
*Southern Economic Journal*, [2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/soej.12248).

Increasingly, international trade policy analysis explores the economic effects of changes in ad-valorem tariffs or equivalent nontariff measures on vertically integrated markets for which high quality data are unavailable. Standard Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) Armington models fail to account for either vertical linkages or parameter uncertainty. Here, we introduce a vertically integrated, nested two-sector Armington model that incorporates uncertainty in the estimates of Armington elasticities through Monte Carlo simulation. As an illustrative case, we model the effects of changes in country of origin labeling (COOL) rules on the market shares of cattle in the U.S. beef market. By accounting for parameter uncertainty in this way, we are able to estimate the distribution of potential effects of repealing mandatory COOL. Ultimately, we predict that, in all but the most extreme cases, Mexico and Canada would not gain as much market share from the repeal of mandatory COOL as they claim in their World Trade Organization (WTO) filings against the regulation.
