### What Are My Chances? Measuring Job Market Beliefs using Incentives

Men and women differ in their job search behavior. I gather a novel data set of resumes, search activities, and search outcomes of business school undergraduates looking for summer internships. In an online experiment, I use this data to elicit studentsâ€™ beliefs regarding the correlation between resume qualifications and likelihood of success on the job market. I incentivize true reporting of these beliefs using a "crossover mechanism" (Allen (1987), Grether (1992), Karni (2009), Mobius et al. (2014)) that has respondents "bet" on the outcomes of other students' job searches. I find that women perceive a stronger correlation between resume qualifications and success than do men, and that this result cannot be explained by gender differences in willingness to rate a resume as "qualified".
